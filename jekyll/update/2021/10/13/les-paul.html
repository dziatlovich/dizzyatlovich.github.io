        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This project started when I enrolled into the university and first found out that there was a workshop.
My roommate has built his own guitar in the past, and as I was learning the guitar, I decided to give it a go as well.
At the time, I didn’t possess all the necessary skills to complete the project, but I was dead set on making it a reality.</p>

<p>I did some research, and realized that going the traditional route of hand-crafting a guitar was wishful thinking on my part.
The skillset required was not only not available to me, but I couldn’t hope to perfect it over my years at the university.
So, as an up and coming engineer, I went with a simpler (arguably, harder) approach of using tools to do the work for me.
I just had to spend a few weeks doing all the design work.</p>

<h2 id="cad">CAD</h2>
<p>I started with picking a guitar I wanted to make. Originally, I was recommended a Telecaster due to the simplicity of its body,
but since I was going to use CNC machines for the manufacturing anyways, it didn’t really matter which guitar I went with.
So I picked my favorite - a Les Paul.</p>

<p>Next, I had to actually design the model of it, which wasn’t terrible. Fortunately, there are schematics of the guitar available online, 
so I had quick access to all the dimensions. There were a few tricky parts, like getting the shape of the top curve exactly, but in the end,
the model was complete.</p>

<p>I used Fusion 360 for this, because it was free.</p>

<h2 id="manufacturing">Manufacturing</h2>

<p>After exporting all the necessary CAM files, it was time to move to the workshop.</p>

<p>For the body, I glued together two blanks of alder. I did the same with 2 blanks of hard maple for the curved top.
The neck was going to be cut from a single blank of mahogany.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../../assets/files/jpg/les-paul-alder.jpg" alt="Body blank gluing together" /></p>

<p>While the glue was setting, I decided to do a test cut on some scrap wood/MDF I found lying around the shop to test
if my toolpaths were correct. The toolpaths for the body were fairly straightforward - I used a regular 1/4 in end mill to 
route the channels for the wires, then used the same bit to cut the body shape from the blank. The top curve was a little more
complicated; I used a 1/4 in ball end mill, and tried to find a good balance between precision and time. In the end, I settled
for the toolpaths that would take around 30 min to finish, and while they produced a somewhat rough surface, some moderate sanding
was enough to make it smooth.</p>

</center>

<p>After making sure that the test cuts turned out fine, I went ahead and cut the real deal. The body turned out fairly well apart from a small chip 
while the top was being cut due to (most probably) directionality of the wood grain and weak clamping. I fixed it by simply routing that part of the
body clean and gluing a shim made out of the leftover maple I had. Apart from cosmetic defect, I do not expect it to influence the quality of
the guitar in the end, so it should be fine.</p>

</center>

<p>I went ahead and sanded everything, and started shaping the binding to get it ready for glueing. I also had to fix some defects in the neck,
as the cutting process was very rough (as you can see from the screenshot above). It ended up fine, and <em>in theory</em> shouldn’t have any effect
on the structural integrity - should be better, in fact… Les Paul guitars are notorious for neck issues.</p>

</center>

<p>I put it together for a test fit, and it was time to glue all the parts together. I had to readjust the parts and sand them a few times to get a very tight
fit (thankfully, I left a generous amount of material during the cutting process, so I had room for a few mistakes).</p>

<p>During the process, however, my fretboard (that I ordered from eBay) snapped in 2,
so I either had to glue it together, or order a new one. I… ordered a new one, since I wasn’t sure it was fixable. My roommate insisted that it was, so
we tried it anyways, and I gifted it to him. Expecting a new project, perhaps?</p>

<p>At last, it was all ready.</p>
